# ☕ Global Coffee Supply Chain

# Project Overview
This project visualizes the global coffee supply chain — from coffee-producing countries to shipment-level analysis — using SQLite and Plotly in Python.  

## Tools Used
- Python (SQLite3, Pandas, Plotly)
- SQLite database: `coffee_supply.db`
- Jupyter Notebook (Carnets on iPad)

## Visualizations
- Total Export Volume by Country: Shows which countries are the biggest coffee exporters.
- Monthly Price Trends: Line charts of price per kg from Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia.
- CO₂ vs. Lead Time: Bubble chart showing environmental impact and shipping efficiency.
- Supplier Ratings: Horizontal bar chart with country-colored visuals.

## Tables Created
- `countries`: Country-wise production and region
- `suppliers`: Supplier info and ratings
- `shipments`: Shipment details with CO₂ and lead time
- `prices`: Monthly coffee price data


## Project Goal
To practice SQL + data visualization creatively while demonstrating supply chain analysis skills with real-world relevance.

## Inspired by
Global supply chain transparency, sustainability tracking, and logistics performance analytics.
